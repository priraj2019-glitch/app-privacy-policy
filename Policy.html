<h2>2. Face Data Policy</h2>

<h3>Collection and Purpose</h3>
<p>
HairTrans AI processes facial data <strong>only</strong> when you upload an image to apply

Face data is used solely to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Detect facial feature points (eyes, nose, facial contours)</li>
    <li>Apply the user-requested visual transformation</li>
</ul>

<p>
The app does <strong>not</strong> perform facial recognition, biometric identification,
or user profiling.
</p>

<h3>Processing</h3>
<p>
Uploaded images are processed temporarily and may be transmitted to secure servers only
for the purpose of generating the requested result.
</p>

<h3>Retention (Explicit Statement)</h3>

    <li>No face data is retained after the result is delivered to the user</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sharing</h3>
<p>
Face data is <strong>not shared, sold, rented, or disclosed</strong> to any third parties
and is never used for advertising or analytics purposes.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The app may use trusted third-party services for cloud infrastructure, analytics,
and crash reporting. These providers are contractually required to protect user data
and do not independently store or retain face data.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your
information, including secure transmission and access controls. However, no method of
storage or transmission is 100% secure.
